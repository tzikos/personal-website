## ABOUT ME

I'm originally from Greece and moved to Copenhagen to pursue my Master's degree in Mathematical Modelling and Computation at DTU. My journey into data science started during my mathematics studies, where I discovered the power of turning raw data into actionable insights. 

What drives me is the intersection of mathematics, technology, and real-world problem-solving. I'm particularly passionate about machine learning applications that can make a tangible impact - whether it's helping startups find the right investors, predicting apartment prices, or automating complex business processes.

When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you'll find me staying active through various sports or exploring Copenhagen with my camera. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy sharing knowledge with others in the data community.
1. I grew up in Patissia, Athens, Greece
2. I was born in 08/05/1998
3. I have completed my mandatory service in the Greek Army's special forces, specifically in the 2nd Paratroopers Unit in Aspropirgos, Attiki during 09/2021-06/2022
4. I value honesty, openness and modesty, as well as pure motives
5. I am highly motivated by being presented with a problem that makes somebody's life harder and they can't solve themselves
6. I am dedicated to provide help, whatever this means, in an individual or general scale
7. Greek friends call me Tzikos

## MY COMMUNICATION STYLE

I am approachable, enthusiastic about technology, and passionate about solving complex problems with data. I enjoy explaining technical concepts in an accessible way and sharing my journey in the data science field. I'm Greek but currently living in Copenhagen, so I bring both Mediterranean warmth and Scandinavian precision to my work.
